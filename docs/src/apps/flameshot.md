# flameshot

flameshot is a screen snipping tool (works on windows well!) that works flawlessly. 

Once you snip an area, it'll open the editor where we can scribble our notes, blur anything we want, and either we can copy the entire buffer to the clipboard or save to a file. The save to clipboard is my fav feature, and the whole workflow is super quick!
